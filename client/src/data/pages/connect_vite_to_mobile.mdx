# ðŸ“± How to Open Vite Dev Server on Your Mobile

Developing locally with Vite is fast and smoothâ€”but what if you want to see how your site looks on an actual mobile device? Good news: it's easy! In this post, you'll learn how to open your Vite dev server on your phone with just a few simple steps.

## ðŸ›  Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. **Get your Computer/PC and Mobile on the same Network**

Get your computer and phone on the same Wi-Fi network, that means both devices should be connected to the same Wi-Fi Network. You can also turn on your Mobile hotspot and connect your Computer if Wi-fi is not available. One connected, you're good to go!
<br/>

### 2. **Find your local IP address**

To let your phone access your Vite dev server, youâ€™ll need your computerâ€™s local IP address â€” this is the address your device uses on your Wi-Fi network. Hereâ€™s how to find it:

   - Run this in your terminal:
   - Look for an `IPv4` address looking something like this `192.168.x.x`.

```
# macOS / Linux
ifconfig | grep inet

# Windows
ipconfig
```
<br/>

### 3. **Run Vite with host flag**

Vite doesnâ€™t share your dev server with the rest of your network, it only runs on `localhost` by default. Thatâ€™s perfect if you are working on a project alone, but if you want to test on your phone or another device, youâ€™ll need to run it with `--host` flag and use your computerâ€™s IP address so other devices can find it.

- To run the server on mobile, you hace to start the vite server with the following command

```
npm run dev -- --host
```

**Note:** This is great for a quick temporary run, if you want to make it stick, you'll need to update the `"dev"` key from `"vite"` to `"vite --host"` in your `package.json` file for a more permanent setup.

```json
"scripts": {
  "dev": "vite --host",
  "build": "vite build",
  "preview": "vite preview"
},
```
<br/>

### 4. **Access the app on your phone**

Once the complete setup is done, on your mobile browser, go to: 
```
http://192.168.x.x:5173
```

> Replace `192.168.x.x` with your computer's local IP.

> Replace the port number `5173` if you have explicitly defined the port number in your `vite.config.js` file.
<br/>

### ðŸª„Tip:

Running the server with the `--host` flag, Vite always shows the Local and Network url which the server runs on.

<div className="p-2 md:p-4 border border-gray-300 rounded-xl overflow-hidden md:w-[70%] md:m-auto">

    src="https://res.cloudinary.com/shubham4538/image/upload/v1745560180/WebBlog/httpsdev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws_sr0136.jpg" 
    alt="Alt text" 
    className="object-cover w-full rounded-md" 
  />
</div>
You should now see the same Vite dev server running on your mobile device. You can interact with it just like you would on your computer.
<br/>

### ðŸ”’ Troubleshooting

- Make sure both devices are on the **same Wi-Fi network**
- Disable firewall or allow traffic on port `5173`
- Try a different browser on your phone if it doesnâ€™t load
<br/>

### Conclusion

Exploring your app on different devices is a great way to see how it performs in the real world. By accessing the Vite dev server from your phone or tablet, you get a firsthand look at how your app behaves on different screen sizes and networks. Itâ€™s a simple trick that can help you spot issues early and make sure everything looks and feels just right. With a little setup, you'll be testing on all your devices in no time!
