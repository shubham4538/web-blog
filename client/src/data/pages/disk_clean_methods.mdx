# 5 Ways to Clean Temp Storage in Windows

In this guide, we will focus on removing Temp files from Windows 11. All these methods are tried and tested, and you will not face any issues related to booting your PC. So without any delay, letâ€™s go ahead and check out the 5 ways to delete Temp files in Windows 11.

## What are Temp Files?

Temp files are temporary data files created by the system or applications to store information while tasks are being processed. They help with things like autosaving, caching, and installations. Though meant to be deleted automatically, they often linger and take up space, so it's safe and helpful to remove them periodically.

## Here are 5 Ways to Clean Temp Storage in Windows âœ¨

### 1. **Create a Middleware File**
Add a `middleware.ts` or `middleware.js` file in the admin folder. Since we are nor using the default middleware, we will create a custom one where aur protected routes will be create.

For eg: `<root>/pages/api/admin/middleware.js`

```
const authMiddleware = (handler) => async (req, res) => {};

export default authMiddleware;
```

> This is a custom logic that will check all specified routes for authentication.
<br/>

### 2. **Connect to the Database & Authenticate User**

The main purpose of this middleware is to connect to the database and check if the user is authenticated. You can use any database connection method you prefer, such as Mongoose for MongoDB.

```
import AdminModel from "@/src/database/models/Admin";
import { connectMongoDB } from "@/src/database/connection";

const authMiddleware = (handler) => async (req, res) => {
  await connectMongoDB();
  const authToken = req.headers.authorization;

  try {
    if (req.method == "GET") {
      const admin = await AdminModel.findById(cookieObject._id);
      // You can use your own logic to check if the user is authenticated
      if (admin.userId !== authToken) {
        return res.status(401).json({ message: "Unauthorized" });
      } else {
        // return the handler function after authentication
        return handler(req, res);
      }
    }
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ err, message: "Unable to Connect" });
  }
};

export default authMiddleware;
```
> You can use any logic to check if the user is authenticated and remeber to return the `handler` function after authentication.
<br/>

### 3. **Apply Middleware to Specific Routes**
To apply the middleware to specific routes, you just need to import the `authMiddleware` function and wrap your API route handler with it.

Like I said earlier, we will be using middleware for the admin routes. So, the file will be in the same `admin` folder, as `<root>/pages/api/admin/index.js`
```
import mongoose from "mongoose";
import { connectMongoDB } from "@/src/database/connection";
import authMiddleware from "../middleware";

async function handler(req, res) {
  try {
    await connectMongoDB();
    // fetch data from the database
    res.status(200).json({ data });
  } catch (err) {
    res.status(500).json({ message: "Unable to Connect" });
  }
}

// This ensures that the middleware is applied to this route
export default authMiddleware(handler);
```
<br/>

### 4. **Send Authorization token from your client side code**
In this example, I have stored the `userId` token in a `cookie`, so to send the authorization token from your client-side code, you have to use the `getServerSideProps` function to fetch the cookie data from the server `request`. 

```
export const getServerSideProps = async (context) => {
  const { req } = context;
  const cookie = req.cookies;

  const response = await fetch(
    "http://localhost:3000/api/admin",
    {
      method: "GET",
      headers: {
        "Content-Type": "application/json",
        Authorization: `Bearer ${cookie.admin}`,
      },
    }
  );
  const data = await response.json();

  return { props: { data } };
  // return { props: { cookie } };
};
```
> You can also pass the `cookie` data to the component to be used in user defined fetch or delete functions
<br/>

## ðŸš€ Conclusion

While Next.js middleware can't directly handle database connections in the Edge Runtime, you can still achieve dynamic, data-driven logic by offloading database operations to API routes. This pattern keeps your application performant, secure, and within platform limitations â€” or gives you full flexibility if you're using Node.js middleware. Use this approach to validate sessions, manage access control, or run any server-side logic before a request hits your route.
